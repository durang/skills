# gbrain-skill

Canonical health dashboard + autonomous brain compounding engine for [GBrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) + [OpenClaw](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openclaw) integrations. Single-command surface to verify the brain stack, detect silent drift, and grow the knowledge graph autonomously while you sleep.

Built on top of 60+ hours debugging GBrain + OpenClaw together — encodes every check that was ever needed to find a root cause, plus a 7th-phase compounding loop that complements the deterministic `gbrain dream` cycle.

## What it does

`bash run.sh check` (or `/gbrain` in Claude Code / OpenClaw) gives you a full markdown dashboard covering:

### 🚨 Alert banner (top, only when critical)
Renders only when one of these is true:
- Stuck sessions detected in the openclaw log within the last hour
- `openclaw-node` process has 0 `*_API_KEY` vars in its environment (MCP children will fail silently)
- Agent model has no fallbacks configured (one timeout = dead session)
- Doctor queue depth > 100 on any worker
- Public Tailscale Funnel TLS desynced (silent downtime)

### 19 main layers + 6 sub-layers (25 sections total)
| # | Layer | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Versiones | GBrain + OpenClaw vs latest published |
| 2 | Runtime | Gateway, Telegram conns, npm loops, model + fallbacks, MCP, SOUL.md directive |
| 3 | Doctor | `gbrain doctor --json` structured table |
| 3b | Schema correlation | DB tables ↔ wrapper ↔ skills (catches silent migration drift) |
| 4 | Stats | Pages / chunks / embedded / links / timeline / tags |

| 11 | MCP Health | Each registered MCP server + binary presence on disk |
| 11b | Wrappers + Integrations | HTTP wrappers, integration recipes, OAuth clients, capture by source |
| 12 | Stuck sessions | Rolling 1h count — symptom of "agent not responding" |
| 13 | Process env audit | `*_API_KEY` in `/proc/$openclaw-node/environ` (catches silent-MCP-failure root) |
| 14 | Cron failure rate (24h) | Reads `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs-state.json` |
| 14b | System crontab (canonical) | Cross-references MANIFEST.json declared vs real crontab |

## 🔄 /gbrain sync — orchestrator (added 2026-05-17)

One command updates **everything** canonically and safely:

1. **Pull monorepo** (git rebase origin/master)
2. **Re-run install.sh** (deploy skills to Claude Code + OpenClaw + HERMES)
3. **HERMES claw migrate** with `--skill-conflict overwrite --yes` (NEVER `--migrate-secrets`)
4. **Auto-restore SOUL.md** from `~/.hermes/canonical/SOUL.md` if migrate overwrote it
5. **Verify md5 cross-runtime** — source ↔ openclaw deploy ↔ claude code deploy

Idempotent. Zero downtime. Bridges stay running. Backups automatic.
Sergio writes `/gbrain sync` and the entire AI agent stack updates without breaking anything.

## ☁️ Layer 19 — AWS Infra Health (added 2026-05-15)

11 controls covering EC2 + AWS account:
- CloudTrail multi-region logging
- GuardDuty active detector
- AWS Budget with alerts ($50/$80/$100% thresholds)
- DLM daily snapshot (7-day retention)
- Security Group canonical (only intentional public ports)
- EBS root volume encrypted
- IMDSv2 forced (IMDSv1 returns 401)
- AWS CLI uses IAM user (NOT root)
- sergio-admin MFA active
- Root user MFA active
- SOUL.md canonical guard (anti-migrate-overwrite)
- GBrain stack/jarvis-v3 page exists (source of truth)

Drift in any control fires red banner + decision log entry.

## 🌙 Compounding Engine (7th phase)

Runs nightly via cron, ~30 min after `gbrain dream`. Adds an LLM-driven semantic phase to the deterministic dream cycle:

1. **Backs up brain state** before any change.
2. **Reads** pages from last 24h + categorical learning state.
3. **Calls LLM** (DeepSeek API by default — uses your `~/.openclaw/.env` key; falls back to `claude --print` if available) with a strict-JSON prompt.
4. **Detects** 7 categories of opportunities:
   - `people_orphans` — names mentioned 2+ times without their own page
   - `page_orphans` — pages with 0 links AND >7 days old
   - `knowledge_gaps` — companies/concepts referenced 3+ times without a page
   - `concept_duplication` — originals with embedding cosine sim >0.92
   - `incomplete_pages` — `LENGTH(compiled_truth) < 100`
   - `archive_decay` — 90+ days no updates AND 0 hits in `mcp_request_log`
   - `synthesis_opportunities` — 3+ originals on same theme → consolidation concept
5. **Auto-applies** changes only in categories with confidence ≥ 0.70 (initial: 0.40-0.80, evolves with reverts).
6. **Journals** every change with revert ID; backs up the brain to `compound/backups/`.
7. **Telegram silent push** at 08:00 with summary (auto-applied / skipped / errors).

After 30+ cycles the engine knows your editorial preferences from the categories you've reverted vs accepted. It's the loop that lets the brain "be smarter than when you went to sleep" while staying within the boundaries you've shown it.

Cron-safe out of the box: auto-loads PATH and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from `~/.openclaw/.env`, since cron doesn't inherit user env.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/durang/gbrain-skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain
cp -r gbrain-skill/. ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/run.sh ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/bootstrap.sh ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/compound/*.sh
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/bootstrap.sh   # verify stack
bash ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/run.sh check   # first dashboard
```

For **Claude Code**, also symlink: `ln -sf ~/.openclaw/skills/gbrain ~/.claude/skills/gbrain` — both invocation paths call the same `run.sh`.

For **automated nightly compounding**, add to crontab:

```
30 10 * * * bash $HOME/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/compound/run.sh run >> $HOME/.gbrain/logs/compound.log 2>&1
0 15 * * * bash $HOME/.openclaw/skills/gbrain/compound/morning-report.sh >> $HOME/.gbrain/logs/compound.log 2>&1
```

(Adjust hours to your timezone — example assumes UTC, runs at 03:30 / 08:00 Hermosillo UTC-7.)

## Requirements

- `gbrain` CLI in `PATH` (tested with v0.22.5 → v0.22.8)
- `openclaw` CLI in `PATH` (tested with v2026.4.23)
- `~/.gbrain/config.json` with `database_url` (Supabase Postgres + pgvector recommended)
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` with at least one MCP server, agent definition, and Telegram channel (optional, only used for drift alerts)
- For compounding engine: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in `~/.openclaw/.env` (or `claude` CLI installed for fallback)
- `psql`, `python3`, `curl` (standard on Amazon Linux 2023 / Ubuntu)

## Why each new layer exists

L11–L16 were added after real incidents:

- **The "MCP gbrain ✅ but everything is broken" incident.** Legacy dashboard reported MCP healthy while the MCP server had been failing every 15 min for hours with `OPENAI_API_KEY missing` — because `openclaw-node` was started by systemd without `EnvironmentFile=`. **L13 process env audit** catches this instantly (count of API keys = 0). **L12 stuck-session detector** flags the symptom. **L14 cron failure rate** shows the GBrain Sync cron failing repeatedly.
- **The "Tailscale Funnel TLS desync silent downtime" incident.** Wrapper restarted post-upgrade, TLS cert went out of sync, public endpoint returned 502 for 3 hours while local `127.0.0.1:8787/health` looked fine. **L11b** now probes the public path explicitly.
- **The "schema migration silent break" risk.** When gbrain merges a migration that renames a column the wrapper depends on, the wrapper 500s in production with no warning. **L3b** now diff-checks expected columns vs actual schema.
- **The "should I upgrade?" decision fatigue.** Every release of gbrain or openclaw triggers a "is it safe?" investigation. **L16** encapsulates senior-engineer judgment heuristics into a single verdict (INSTALAR / ESPERAR / SKIP) with concrete reasons + issue links.

## Operating principles (PRINCIPLES.md)

The skill follows non-negotiable rules — no local workarounds that mask upstream signals, no "noise filters" that drift over time, every canonical-vs-workaround decision logged with a date stamp. See `PRINCIPLES.md` for the full list and decision log.

## Caveats

- Reads only by default — `fix` subcommand is idempotent and only runs known-safe operations. Never modifies code, only state (re-extract, re-embed, re-validate).
- L8/L15 hit GitHub API unauthenticated → rate-limited at 60 req/h per IP. If you exceed, those sections show empty; nothing else breaks.
- L13 reads `/proc/$pid/environ` which is mode `0400` (owner only). Run as the same user that owns `openclaw-node`.
- Compounding engine writes to your brain. Always run `dry-run` first on a new install. The journal records every change with a revert ID.
- The script is bash + Python 3 + `gbrain` + `openclaw` CLIs + `curl`. No external dependencies installed.

## Upstream

- [garrytan/gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) — the brain itself
- [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the runtime
- PRs in flight: [#481](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/pull/481) (claude-code-capture recipe), [#509](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain/pull/509) (compounding-engine recipe)
- Issues open: [#73327](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/73327) (per-job stuckThresholdMs)

## Installing on a new machine

Interactive bootstrap that detects your OS, installs the canonical GBrain from GitHub (not the squatted npm package), reuses or creates the brain config, and asks per-client which MCP clients to wire (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf — and explicitly skips clients that need an HTTP wrapper not yet available):

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/bootstrap.sh)
```

Full prompt-by-prompt walkthrough in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Connecting multiple clients to one brain

See [CONNECT.md](CONNECT.md) for the verified compatibility matrix. Stdio clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) connect locally; HTTP+OAuth clients (Claude Desktop, claude.ai web, Cowork, mobile, Perplexity) connect via the [HTTP wrapper](https://github.com/durang/gbrain-http-wrapper) — see [PHASE_4_GUIDE.md](PHASE_4_GUIDE.md) for the complete recipe with OAuth 2.1, OIDC discovery, and all 11 bug-fix iterations documented.

## Architecture audit

[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) is the end-to-end mental model — diagrams of the multi-machine brain, per-machine zoom (config / binary / serve / jobs / autopilot), full inventory of what is connected and why (and what is NOT and why), data-flow walkthrough of a write-on-laptop / read-on-server roundtrip, and a 6-step audit checklist to run on each node.

## Ambient capture for Claude Code

By default, Claude Code does NOT write to GBrain — the MCP wiring lets the model query/write when it chooses, but conversational sessions end without leaving a trail. [CAPTURE.md](CAPTURE.md) documents the Claude Code Stop hook that mirrors OpenClaw's `signal-detector` skill: at session end, a Python script runs in background, asks Haiku to extract decisions / original thinking / entities / concepts, and writes selective pages to GBrain. The full transcript is NOT saved (that would be noise) — only signals worth keeping.

Install with one command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/install-capture.sh)
```

Health check + auto-repair:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/capture-doctor.sh)         # check
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/capture-doctor.sh) --fix   # repair
```

## Progression tracker

`progression.sh` is a stateful walkthrough of the full multi-client setup. Auto-detects which phases you have done, which are pending, and tells you exactly what to do next. Every claim is evidence-based (filesystem + config inspection — no remembered state):

```bash
# Status overview + next action (markdown)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/progression.sh)

# Just the next pending action, terse
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/progression.sh) --next

# Save report into your shared brain (queryable from any machine)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/progression.sh) --save

# Detail for one specific phase
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/durang/gbrain-skill/master/progression.sh) --phase 5A
```

Tracks 9 phases (Phase 0 install → Phase 4D upstream contribution). Reinstall from scratch and the same script walks you back through every step in order.
